# csv-postgres-ingestion
This project is ideal for automating the process of ingesting data from CSV files into a PostgreSQL database, when dealing with multiple CSV files that need to be loaded into their own respective tables. It is useful for anyone working on data migration, ETL pipelines, or simple CSV-to-database ingestion tasks.
